//! A C interface for the [cuckoofilter crate].
//!
//! You can use this crate to use the `cuckoofilter` crate from C/C++, or almost any other
//! language. There only needs to be a way to call foreign C functions, like in python or ruby.
//!
//! **Note**: For other languages, you'd probably want to add a language-specific layer on top of
//! this, e.g. using [milksnake] for python. Contributions welcome!
//!
//! # Build Setup
//!
//! You need to integrate this crate in your build system somehow, how you do this depends on your
//! specific build system. You can e.g. use a local checkout of the [cuckoofilter crate]:
//!
//! ```bash
//! git clone https://github.com/seiflotfy/rust-cuckoofilter
//! cd rust-cuckoofilter/cabi
//! cargo build --release
//! ```
//!
//! Then, put the generated file `cabi/target/include/rcf_cuckoofilter.h` on your compiler's
//! include path and link against either `cabi/target/release/libcuckoofilter_cabi.a` or
//! `cabi/target/release/libcuckoofilter_cabi.so`, depending on whether you want static or dynamic
//! linking. Alternatively, use the provided Makefile via `sudo make install` to install the header
//! and libraries system-wide. You can see the `tests` directory for basic examples using a
//! Makefile for C and C++, including static and dynamic linking in each case.
//!
//! If you found a nice way to integrate this crate in a build system,
//! please consider contributing the necessary build files!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! You can then use the interface like this:
//!
//! ```C
//! #include "rcf_cuckoofilter.h"
//!
//! rcf_cuckoofilter *filter = rcf_cuckoofilter_with_capacity(1000);
//! rcf_cuckoofilter_status result;
//! result = rcf_cuckoofilter_add(filter, 42);
//! assert(result == RCF_OK);
//! result = rcf_cuckoofilter_contains(filter, 42);
//! assert(result == RCF_OK);
//! result = rcf_cuckoofilter_delete(filter, 42);
//! assert(result == RCF_OK);
//! result = rcf_cuckoofilter_contains(filter, 42);
//! assert(result == RCF_NOT_FOUND);
//! ```
//!
//! # Hashing arbitrary data
//! The interface only takes unsigned 64bit integers as `data`.
//! If you want to insert structs or other types, search for something that hashes those to
//! integers. Those hashes don't need to be well-distributed as they're
//! hashed on the rust side again, so a very simple hash function is sufficient,
//! like `std::hash` for C++ or the `__hash__` method in python.
//! There's a good chance something like this is present in the
//! respective standard library, for implementing hash tables and the like.
//!
//! In the future, the interface could accept a pointer to arbitrary memory and a size parameter,
//! and hash that as byte array on the Rust side. But this approach is problematic if not all given
//! bytes are the same for two equal objects.
//!
//! # Naming
//! The prefix `rcf` is short for *rust cuckoo filter*.
//! It's used for C-style namespacing to avoid name conflicts with other libraries.
//!
